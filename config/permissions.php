| Single source of truth for every permission in the application.
|
| Permissions are NOT created by hand through the UI. They are declared here
| and pushed into the database by PermissionsSeeder (or `php artisan
| permission:sync`). A permission that is not in this file does not exist.
|
| Why: `@can('product.view')` in a Blade file and a hand-typed
| `prodcut.view` row in the database fail silently — the gate just returns
| false and the menu item disappears with no error. Declaring them here means
| the string in the code and the string in the database come from one place.
|
| To add a module: add it under the right group below, then run
| `php artisan permission:sync`.

     * Groups are named for the desk that works them, and they are the same

     *
     * ## What was removed, and why
     *
     * The client's own prototype sidebar runs Inquiries -> Order Confirmations
     * -> Purchase Orders -> Goods Inward -> Packing -> Export Docs, and nothing
     * else. Five modules we had declared do not appear anywhere in it:
     *
     *   quotation        A quotation is what a costed inquiry prints. Keeping a
     *                    separate module meant re-entering the same buyer,
     *                    items and prices on a second screen. Becomes an
     *                    inquiry.export action.
     *   quality-check    Accepted and rejected quantity are recorded as the
     *                    goods are received. A separate screen meant opening
     *                    the same PO twice. Becomes inward-entry.approve.
     *   shipment         Booking, container and BL details belong on the
     *                    document set they print onto. Folded into
     *                    export-document, which gains create/edit/delete.
     *   sample-approval  Not in the client's flow. A sample is a status on the
     *                    PO, not a module — reconfirm on the call.
     *   material-issue   Only exists if we issue our own fabric and trims to
     *                    the jobber. Open question on the call.
     *
     *   contract         Removed separately: it never had a screen. A contract
     *                    number is a field on the order for direct-order
     *                    buyers (see buyers.order_mode).
     *
     * None of this is lost work — no screen existed for any of them. Any that
     * the client asks back for is one entry here plus one sidebar block.
